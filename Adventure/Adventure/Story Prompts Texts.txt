Intro to story (user presses enter after each line to continue throughout the story)
In this text-based adventure game, you play as a Pilot named Connor.
Connor originates from London, England where he recently purchased a new taildagger (an airplane designed for 1).
Connor has been invited to special holiday events in Germany and has decided to use his taildagger to get there.
During the flight, Connor's taildagger undergoes a tragic mechanical failure and the engine gives way.
Fortunately, Connor had enough control of the airplane to safely land. 
Unfortunately, he just landed on an unknown and unmapped island.
It is now your job to find supplies from the island that Connor can use to repair the airplane.
The required items you need can be found in the Supplies list in your inventory.
